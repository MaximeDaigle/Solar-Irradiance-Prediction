# Submission execution
We don't have a requirement.txt in our project since everyone was working on different environments (conda windows, pip on mac and cluster does not have access to internet.) All the required python packages are installed on the cluster prior to execution in "evaluation_script.sh"

To run the evaluation: 
* Modify the "evaluation_script.sh to point to your own admin_config.json
* run on cluster with: sbatch evaluation_script.sh
